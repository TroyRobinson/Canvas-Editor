# Interactive Canvas Builder

An interactive web-based canvas application that allows users to create, manipulate, and organize visual elements in a flexible workspace. This application provides a comprehensive set of tools for building interactive layouts with frames, elements, and nested containers.

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with a modular JavaScript architecture where each file handles a specific aspect of functionality. All modules communicate through global event listeners and shared state management.

### Core Files

#### `index.html`
The main HTML structure that defines:
- Canvas container (`#canvas`) - The main workspace
- Zoom indicator for displaying current zoom level
- Help text with keyboard shortcuts
- Sequential loading of JavaScript modules in dependency order

#### `styles.css`
Comprehensive CSS styling defining:
- Dark theme visual design
- Frame and element-frame styling with visual hierarchy
- Resize handle positioning and interaction states
- Selection states and marquee selection styling
- Performance optimizations (will-change properties)
- Responsive grid background pattern
- **Mode-specific styling**: Interactive mode hides selection indicators via `data-canvas-mode` attribute selectors

### Core Modules

#### `js/comment-manager.js`
**Purpose**: HTML comment visualization with interactive bubbles and Comment Mode editing
- **Comment Detection**: Scans for HTML comment nodes (`<!-- comment -->`) in all elements
- **Visual Indicators**: Blue bubble (üí¨) positioned outside element boundaries (only shown for elements with existing comments)

- **Input Elements**: Text inputs wrapped in containers for resize handle support
- **Lines**: Simple divider elements
- **Circles**: Circular visual elements
- All free-floating elements can be dragged, resized, and moved between containers

## Key Interaction Patterns

### Mode Switching (Iframe-Based)
1. **Edit Mode** (default): Clean content editing without script execution
   - Element creation, selection, dragging, resizing
   - All keyboard shortcuts active  
   - Selection indicators visible (blue outlines, resize handles)
   - Scripts disabled to prevent event handler conflicts
2. **Interactive Mode**: Isolated script testing via iframe previews
   - Scripts execute in iframe isolation
   - Frame title bars remain visible for context
   - Iframe positioned to overlay frame content exactly
   - Toggle via checkbox in top-right corner or Ctrl/Cmd+E

### Creation Workflow
1. Press keyboard shortcut (F, R, T, etc.) to enter placement mode
2. Move mouse to position element
3. Click to place, or click+drag to place and size simultaneously
4. Element automatically gets resize handles and drag capabilities

### Extraction Workflow
1. Ctrl/Cmd + click on any element inside a frame
2. Element converts from static to free-floating
3. Immediately becomes draggable and resizable
4. Can be moved to other containers

### Multi-Selection Workflow
1. Shift+click elements to add to selection
2. Marquee select by dragging rectangle on empty canvas
3. All selected elements move together during drag operations
4. **Cmd/Ctrl + G**: Group selected elements into element-frame container

### Drag Duplication Workflow
1. Select element(s) using any selection method
2. **Option/Alt + drag**: Duplicates free-floating elements (frames, element-frames, extracted elements)
3. **Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + drag**: Duplicates static elements AND makes them free-floating (extraction+duplication)
4. Duplicates are created and immediately dragged
5. **Keep duplicates**: Release mouse while holding modifier keys
6. **Cancel operation**: Release Option/Alt before mouse-up (aborts drag, deletes duplicates)

### Keyboard Duplication Workflow
1. Select element(s) using any selection method
2. **Ctrl/Cmd + D**: Duplicate selection in place
3. **Ctrl/Cmd + C**, then **Ctrl/Cmd + V**: Copy and paste selection
   - Pasting onto a free-floating element overlays the copy
   - Pasting inside a flex container inserts the copy after the current element respecting flex direction

### Size & Weight Shortcuts
1. **1-8**: Set text/button size for selected elements
2. **Shift + 1-8**: Set font weight for selected text or buttons
3. **Scroll**: Cycle through text/button size steps
4. **Shift + Scroll**: Cycle through font weight for selected text or buttons

### Text Editing Workflow
1. **Double-click** any text element (h1-h6, p, div.text-element, etc.) to enter edit mode
2. Element shows blue outline and light background when editing
3. Type, select, delete text as needed - space key works normally
4. **Click outside** the element or press **Escape/Enter** to exit edit mode
5. Dragging is disabled while editing to prevent accidental moves

### Right Pane & Code Editing Workflow
1. **Click toggle button** (top-right) ‚Üí Opens right-side tabbed panel
2. **Select any element** ‚Üí Switches to Code Editor tab if panel is open (HTML mode)
3. **Click canvas (no selection)** ‚Üí Shows global CSS in Code Editor if panel is open (CSS mode)
4. **Toggle HTML/CSS modes** ‚Üí Use buttons in code editor header to switch
5. **Type HTML/CSS changes** ‚Üí Canvas updates automatically after 200ms pause
6. **Use Ctrl/Cmd+Z in code editor** ‚Üí Instant undo/redo within editor (native browser behavior)
7. **Click on canvas or switch elements** ‚Üí Code change recorded in canvas undo system
8. **Press Ctrl/Cmd+Z on canvas** ‚Üí Reverts entire element to previous HTML state
9. **Click X button** ‚Üí Closes panel, shows toggle button again
10. **Drag panel border** ‚Üí Resize panel width (persisted)

### AI Enhancement with Custom Messages Workflow
1. **Select a frame** ‚Üí Chat/History tab shows frame-specific enhancement history
2. **Choose enhancement mode** ‚Üí Toggle between "Editing" (keeps existing code) and "Replacing" (starts fresh)
3. **Type custom message** ‚Üí Describe desired functionality in the text area
4. **Press Enter or click send** ‚Üí Triggers AI enhancement with custom instructions
5. **View history** ‚Üí Custom messages appear prominently in history cards with frame reference
6. **Configure prompts** ‚Üí Settings/Context tab has three prompt templates for different enhancement types

### Script Activation Workflow (Iframe-Based)
1. **Edit Mode**: Scripts are **not executed** - pure content editing without script interference
2. **Interactive Mode**: Scripts execute **only in iframe isolation** for safe testing
3. **Mode Switching**: Iframe creation uses current frame HTML with injected global CSS
4. **Script Isolation**: All user scripts run in iframe context, completely separated from Canvas editor
5. **Natural Cleanup**: Iframe destruction automatically cleans up all script event handlers
6. **Visual Continuity**: Frame title bars and borders remain visible during interactive preview

### Deletion Workflow
1. Select any element(s) using single-click, shift+click, or marquee selection
2. Press Backspace to delete all selected elements
3. Deletion is protected when typing in input fields or contentEditable elements

### Container Management
- Elements automatically switch containers when dragged over new parents
- Frame resizing triggers automatic container reassignment for contained elements
- Zoom and pan operations maintain relative positioning
- In flexbox containers created with **Shift + A**, child elements remain individually selectable, and dragging a child without Cmd/Ctrl reorders it within the flex flow

## Performance Optimizations

- **will-change CSS properties** for smooth animations during drag/resize/zoom
- **Event capture and delegation** for efficient event handling
- **Coordinate caching** during drag operations
- **Mutation observers** for automatic element setup without manual registration
- **Iframe isolation** eliminates complex script event handler cleanup (~350 lines removed)

## Global State Management

The application uses a distributed state management approach where each module exposes necessary functions and state through the `window` object:

- `window.canvasZoom` - Zoom and coordinate utilities
- `window.isPanning` - Pan state
- `window.selectElement`, `window.getSelectedElements` - Selection management
- `window.isResizing`, `window.isInPlacementMode` - Operation state flags
- `window.undoManager` - Undo/redo system instance
- `window.recordCreate`, `window.recordDelete`, `window.recordMove`, `window.recordElementReplacement`, etc. - Operation recording functions
- `window.textEditing` - Text editing state and utilities (isEditing, getCurrentlyEditingElement)
- `window.canvasMode` - Current mode state ('edit' or 'interactive')
- `window.rightPaneManager` - Right pane UI API (registerTab, switchToTab, show, hide, isVisible)
- `window.codeEditor` - Code editor tab API (show, hide, isActive, updateCodeView, showCSSEditor)
- `window.cssManager` - CSS management API (getCurrentCSS, updateCSS, hasBeenEdited, initialize, injectIntoIframe)
- `window.iframeManager` - Iframe preview API (createPreviewIframe, showIframe, hideIframe, destroyIframe, positionIframe)

This architecture allows modules to coordinate without tight coupling while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

## Technical Considerations for Undo/Redo

### Multi-Element Operations
- **Batching**: Multi-element moves and deletes are recorded as single commands, not wrapped in additional batch containers
- **Container Changes**: Position recording happens AFTER container changes to ensure accurate coordinate capture
- **State Capture**: Complete DOM state including positioning data, styles, and hierarchy is preserved

### HTML Structure Changes
- **Element Replacement**: Code editor changes use `recordElementReplacement` for complete HTML structure updates
- **Focus/Blur Snapshots**: Before/after HTML states captured on code editor focus and blur events
- **Native vs Canvas Undo**: Code editor supports native browser undo within textarea, plus canvas undo for complete element restoration

### Text Editing Integration
- **Complete Edit Tracking**: Text changes from enter ‚Üí edit ‚Üí exit are recorded as single undo operations
- **Duplicate Prevention**: MutationObserver pauses characterData tracking during active editing
- **Content Comparison**: Only records changes when text actually differs from original

### Cross-Container Movement
- **Coordinate Systems**: Positions are stored relative to containers, with fallback absolute coordinates
- **Static Elements**: Document flow positioning is tracked using sibling IDs and insertion hints
- **Restoration**: Elements return to exact positions even after complex cross-container operations

### Debug Utilities
```javascript
enableUndoDebug()     // Enable detailed console logging
inspectUndoHistory()  // View command history structure
disableUndoDebug()    // Turn off debug logging
```
