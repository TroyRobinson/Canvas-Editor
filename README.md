# Interactive Canvas Builder

An interactive web-based canvas application that allows users to create, manipulate, and organize visual elements in a flexible workspace. This application provides a comprehensive set of tools for building interactive layouts with frames, elements, and nested containers.

## Architecture Overview

The application is built with a modular JavaScript architecture where each file handles a specific aspect of functionality. All modules communicate through global event listeners and shared state management.

### Core Files

#### `index.html`
The main HTML structure that defines:
- Canvas container (`#canvas`) - The main workspace
- Zoom indicator for displaying current zoom level
- Help text with keyboard shortcuts
- Sequential loading of JavaScript modules in dependency order

#### `styles.css`
Comprehensive CSS styling defining:
- Dark theme visual design
- Frame and element-frame styling with visual hierarchy
- Resize handle positioning and interaction states
- Selection states and marquee selection styling
- Performance optimizations (will-change properties)
- Responsive grid background pattern
- **Mode-specific styling**: Interactive mode hides selection indicators via `data-canvas-mode` attribute selectors

### Core Modules

#### `js/canvas.js`
**Purpose**: Core canvas initialization and z-index management
- Initializes the canvas with default frames
- Manages `frameCounter` for unique element IDs
- Provides `bringToFront()` function for z-index layering
- Serves as the foundation that other modules build upon

#### `js/zoom.js`
**Purpose**: Handles canvas zooming and coordinate transformation
- Mouse wheel zoom with Ctrl/Cmd modifier
- Zoom-to-mouse-point functionality for intuitive navigation
- Coordinate conversion between screen space and canvas space
- Pan support integrated with zoom transforms
- Global `window.canvasZoom` API for other modules
- **Key relationships**: Used by drag, resize, and element-creation modules for coordinate calculations

#### `js/pan.js`
**Purpose**: Canvas panning with spacebar + mouse drag
- Spacebar hold detection for pan mode
- Mouse drag panning with visual feedback
- Integration with zoom system for accurate positioning
- Global `window.isPanning` state for preventing conflicts

  - Preserves element selection state across mode transitions

## Element Hierarchy and Types

### Frames
- **Full Frames**: Complete UI containers with title bars and content areas
- **Element-Frames**: Simple container divs for grouping related elements
- Both types can contain free-floating elements and other nested containers

### Free-Floating Elements
- **Text Elements**: Editable text with contentEditable
- **Buttons**: Interactive buttons with click handlers
- **Input Elements**: Text inputs wrapped in containers for resize handle support
- **Lines**: Simple divider elements
- **Circles**: Circular visual elements
- All free-floating elements can be dragged, resized, and moved between containers

## Key Interaction Patterns

### Mode Switching
1. **Edit Mode** (default): Full canvas editing capabilities
   - Element creation, selection, dragging, resizing
   - All keyboard shortcuts active
   - Selection indicators visible (blue outlines, resize handles)
2. **Interactive Mode**: Test interactive elements
   - Button onclick handlers execute
   - Input fields accept focus and text
   - Selection indicators hidden for clean interaction
   - Toggle via checkbox in top-right corner

### Creation Workflow
1. Press keyboard shortcut (F, R, T, etc.) to enter placement mode
2. Move mouse to position element
3. Click to place, or click+drag to place and size simultaneously
4. Element automatically gets resize handles and drag capabilities

### Extraction Workflow
1. Ctrl/Cmd + click on any element inside a frame
2. Element converts from static to free-floating
3. Immediately becomes draggable and resizable
4. Can be moved to other containers

### Multi-Selection Workflow
1. Shift+click elements to add to selection
2. Marquee select by dragging rectangle on empty canvas
3. All selected elements move together during drag operations
4. **Cmd/Ctrl + G**: Group selected elements into element-frame container

### Drag Duplication Workflow
1. Select element(s) using any selection method
2. **Option/Alt + drag**: Duplicates free-floating elements (frames, element-frames, extracted elements)
3. **Cmd/Ctrl + Option/Alt + drag**: Duplicates static elements AND makes them free-floating (extraction+duplication)
4. Duplicates are created and immediately dragged
5. **Keep duplicates**: Release mouse while holding modifier keys
6. **Cancel operation**: Release Option/Alt before mouse-up (aborts drag, deletes duplicates)

### Text Editing Workflow
1. **Double-click** any text element (h1-h6, p, div.text-element, etc.) to enter edit mode
2. Element shows blue outline and light background when editing
3. Type, select, delete text as needed - space key works normally
4. **Click outside** the element or press **Escape/Enter** to exit edit mode
5. Dragging is disabled while editing to prevent accidental moves

### Deletion Workflow
1. Select any element(s) using single-click, shift+click, or marquee selection
2. Press Backspace to delete all selected elements
3. Deletion is protected when typing in input fields or contentEditable elements

### Container Management
- Elements automatically switch containers when dragged over new parents
- Frame resizing triggers automatic container reassignment for contained elements
- Zoom and pan operations maintain relative positioning

## Performance Optimizations

- **will-change CSS properties** for smooth animations during drag/resize/zoom
- **Event capture and delegation** for efficient event handling
- **Coordinate caching** during drag operations
- **Mutation observers** for automatic element setup without manual registration

## Global State Management

The application uses a distributed state management approach where each module exposes necessary functions and state through the `window` object:

- `window.canvasZoom` - Zoom and coordinate utilities
- `window.isPanning` - Pan state
- `window.selectElement`, `window.getSelectedElements` - Selection management
- `window.isResizing`, `window.isInPlacementMode` - Operation state flags
- `window.undoManager` - Undo/redo system instance
- `window.recordCreate`, `window.recordDelete`, `window.recordMove`, etc. - Operation recording functions
- `window.textEditing` - Text editing state and utilities (isEditing, getCurrentlyEditingElement)
- `window.canvasMode` - Current mode state ('edit' or 'interactive')

This architecture allows modules to coordinate without tight coupling while maintaining clear separation of concerns.

## Technical Considerations for Undo/Redo

### Multi-Element Operations
- **Batching**: Multi-element moves and deletes are recorded as single commands, not wrapped in additional batch containers
- **Container Changes**: Position recording happens AFTER container changes to ensure accurate coordinate capture
- **State Capture**: Complete DOM state including positioning data, styles, and hierarchy is preserved

### Text Editing Integration
- **Complete Edit Tracking**: Text changes from enter â†’ edit â†’ exit are recorded as single undo operations
- **Duplicate Prevention**: MutationObserver pauses characterData tracking during active editing
- **Content Comparison**: Only records changes when text actually differs from original

### Cross-Container Movement
- **Coordinate Systems**: Positions are stored relative to containers, with fallback absolute coordinates
- **Static Elements**: Document flow positioning is tracked using sibling IDs and insertion hints
- **Restoration**: Elements return to exact positions even after complex cross-container operations

### Debug Utilities
```javascript
enableUndoDebug()     // Enable detailed console logging
inspectUndoHistory()  // View command history structure
disableUndoDebug()    // Turn off debug logging
```
